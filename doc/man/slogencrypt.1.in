.SS "Description"
.PP
The slogencrypt utility is used to encrypt plain text log file using an existing secure logging environment. Using this utility, log files obtained from a previous installation of syslog-ng or another logging system can be transferred to a secure logging environment. The order of the log entries is preserved. Encrypting plain text log files using an existing secure logging environment, requires the current encryption key to be supplied in order to preserve consistency.
