.SH NAME
.PP
syslog\-ng\-debun \-\-\- syslog\-ng DEBUg buNdle generator
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
syslog\-ng\-debun [options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBNOTE:\fP The syslog\-ng\-debun application is distributed with the syslog\-ng OSE
system logging application, and is usually part of the syslog\-ng OSE
package. The latest version of the syslog\-ng OSE application is
available at the syslog\-ng OSE page.
.PP
This manual page is only an abstract.
.PP
The syslog\-ng\-debun tool collects and saves information about your
syslog\-ng OSE installation, making troubleshooting easier, especially if
you ask help about your syslog\-ng OSE related problem.
.SH GENERAL OPTIONS
.PP
\fB\fC\-r\fR
    Run syslog\-ng\-debun. Using this option is required to actually
    execute the data collection with syslog\-ng\-debun. It is needed to
    prevent accidentally running syslog\-ng\-debun.
.PP
\fB\fC\-h\fR
    Display the help page.
.PP
\fB\fC\-l\fR
    Do not collect privacy\-sensitive data, for example, process tree,
    fstab, and so on. If you use with \-d, then the following parameters
    will be used for debug mode:\-Fev
.PP
\fB\fC\-R <directory>\fR
    The directory where syslog\-ng PE is installed instead of
    /opt/syslog\-ng.
.PP
\fB\fC\-W <directory>\fR
    Set the working directory, where the debug bundle will be saved.
    Default value: /tmp. The name of the created file is
    syslog.debun.${host}.${date}.${3\-random\-characters\-or\-pid}.tgz
.SH DEBUG MODE OPTIONS
.PP
\fB\fC\-d\fR
    Start syslog\-ng OSE in debug mode, using the \-Fedv \-\-enable\-core
    options.
.PP
.RS
.nf
![](/assets/images/caution.png) **CAUTION:**
Using this option under high message load may increase disk I/O
during the debug, and the resulting debug bundle can be huge. To exit debug
mode, press Enter.
.fi
.RE
.PP
\fB\fC\-D <options>\fR
    Start syslog\-ng OSE in debug mode, using the specified command\-line
    options. To exit debug mode, press Enter.
.PP
\fB\fC\-t <seconds>\fR
    Run syslog\-ng OSE in noninteractive debug mode for <seconds>, and
    automatically exit debug mode after the specified number of seconds.
.PP
\fB\fC\-w <seconds>\fR
    Wait <seconds> seconds before starting debug mode.
.SH SYSTEM CALL TRACING
.PP
\fB\fC\-s\fR
    Enable syscall tracing (strace \-f or truss \-f). Note that using \fB\fC\-s\fR
    itself does not enable debug mode, only traces the system calls of
    an already running syslog\-ng OSE process. To trace system calls in
    debug mode, use both the \fB\fC\-s\fR and \fB\fC\-d\fR options.
.SH PACKET CAPTURE OPTIONS
.PP
Capturing packets requires a packet capture tool on the host. The
syslog\-ng\-debun tool attempts to use tcpdump on most platforms, except for
Solaris, where it uses snoop.
.PP
\fB\fC\-i <interface>\fR
    Capture packets only on the specified interface, for example, eth0.
.PP
\fB\fC\-p\fR
    Capture incoming packets using the following filter: port 514 or
    port 601 or port 53
.PP
\fB\fC\-P <options>\fR
    Capture incoming packets using the specified filter.
.PP
\fB\fC\-t <seconds>\fR
    Run syslog\-ng OSE in noninteractive debug mode for <seconds>, and
    automatically exit debug mode after the specified number of seconds.
.SS EXAMPLES:
.PP
.RS
.nf
syslog\-ng\-debun \-r
.fi
.RE
.PP
Create a simple debug bundle, collecting information about your
environment, for example, list packages containing the word: syslog, ldd
of your syslog\-binary, and so on.
.PP
.RS
.nf
syslog\-ng\-debun \-r \-l
.fi
.RE
.PP
Similar to syslog\-ng\-debun \-r, but without privacy\-sensitive
information. For example, the following is NOT collected: fstab, df
output, mount info, ip / network interface configuration, DNS resolv
info, and process tree.
.PP
.RS
.nf
syslog\-ng\-debun \-r \-d
.fi
.RE
.PP
Similar to syslog\-ng\-debun \-r, but it also stops syslog\-ng OSE, then
restarts it in debug mode (\-Fedv \-\-enable\-core). To stop debug mode,
press Enter. The output of the debug mode collected into a separate
file, and also added to the debug bundle.
.PP
.RS
.nf
syslog\-ng\-debun \-r \-s
.fi
.RE
.PP
Trace the system calls (using strace or truss) of an already running
syslog\-ng OSE process.
.PP
.RS
.nf
syslog\-ng\-debun \-r \-d \-s
.fi
.RE
.PP
Restart syslog\-ng OSE in debug mode, and also trace the system calls
(using strace or truss) of the syslog\-ng OSE process.
.PP
.RS
.nf
syslog\-ng\-debun \-r \-p
.fi
.RE
.PP
Run packet capture (pcap) with the filter: port 514 or port 601 or port
53 Also waits for pressing Enter, like debug mode.
.PP
.RS
.nf
syslog\-ng\-debun \-r \-p \-t 10
.fi
.RE
.PP
Noninteractive debug mode: Similar to syslog\-ng\-debun \-r \-p, but
automatically exit after 10 seconds.
.PP
.RS
.nf
syslog\-ng\-debun \-r \-P "host 1.2.3.4"  \-D "\-Fev \-\-enable\-core"
.fi
.RE
.PP
Change the packet\-capturing filter from the default to host 1.2.3.4.
Also change debugging parameters from the default to \-Fev
\-\-enable\-core. Since a timeout (\-t) is not given, waits for pressing
Enter.
.PP
.RS
.nf
syslog\-ng\-debun \-r \-p \-d \-w 5 \-t 10
.fi
.RE
.PP
Collect pcap and debug mode output following this scenario:
.RS
.IP \(bu 2
Start packet capture with default parameters (\-p)
.IP \(bu 2
Wait 5 seconds (\-w 5)
.IP \(bu 2
Stop syslog\-ng
.IP \(bu 2
Start syslog\-ng OSE in debug mode with default parameters (\-d)
.IP \(bu 2
Wait 10 seconds (\-t 10)
.IP \(bu 2
Stop syslog\-ng OSE debuging
.IP \(bu 2
Start syslog\-ng OSE
.IP \(bu 2
Stop packet capturing
