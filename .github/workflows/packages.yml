      # This workflow runs on every PR and push, and the goal is to pre-test all the possible distros
      # we might want to create a package for ever (ideally it can be any supported distro we have in the dbld images),
      # so it is a good idea to sync this with the dbld/rules file BUILDER_IMAGES.
      #
      # NOTE: runnig always on all distros is time and resource consuming, so it can be considered to run only on
      #       distros that are really produced a final package for (actually the mid and lower blocks in the distros list).
      #
      # upper block for   dbld docker images only
      # mid block for     dbld docker + binary packages
      # lower block for   dbld docker + binary packages + docker binary
