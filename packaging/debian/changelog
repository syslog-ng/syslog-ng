    And a patch were a next session start before the previous

  * [114f0e0] Try again using tagged git release as orig.tar.gz
    Now, after some time I'm a bit more confident that using a naked git
    release is better than the full-featured and all-including release.
    First, it is much smaller.  Especially because it does not contain all
    of the third party libraries which are not used in Debian.  Second
    reason is that this can be followed much easily, because this is the
    same as any particular state in the git repo, so a snapshot can be more
    easily used if this is the daily routine.
