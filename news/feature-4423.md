`system()`, `darwin-oslog()`, `darwin-oslog-stream()` sources: Added 2 darwin OSLog based sources `darwin-oslog()` and `darwin-oslog-stream()`.

'darwin-oslog()' replaced the earlier file source based solution with a native OSLog framework based one, and is automatically used in the `system()` source on darwin platform if the **darwinosl** plugin is presented.


### darwin-oslog

This is a native OSLog framework based source to read logs from the local store of the unified logging system on darwin OSes.
For more info, see https://developer.apple.com/documentation/oslog?language=objc


The following parameters can be used for customization:

- filter-predicate
    - string value, which can be used to filter the log messages natively
    - default value: `(eventType == 'logEvent' || eventType == 'lossEvent' || eventType == 'stateEvent' || eventType == 'userActionEvent') && (logType != 'debug')`
    - for more details, see
        - `man log`
        - https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/Predicates/Articles/pSyntax.html
- go-reverse
    - boolean value, setting to **yes** will provide a reverse-ordered log list (from latest to oldest)
    - default value: **no**
- do-not-use-bookmark
    - boolean value, setting to **yes** will prevent syslog-ng from continuing to feed the logs from the last remembered position after a (re-)start, which means, depending on the other settings, the feed will always start from the end/beginning of the available log list
    - default value: **no**, which means syslog-ng will attempt to continue feeding from the last remembered log position after a (re-)start
- max-bookmark-distance
    - integer value, maximum distance in seconds that far an earlier bookmark can point backward, e.g. if syslog-ng was stopped for 10 minutes and max-bookmark-distance is set to 60 then syslog-ng will start feeding the logs only from the last 60 seconds at startup, 9 minutes of logs 'will be lost'
    - default value: 0, which means no limit
- read-old-records
    - boolean value, controls if syslog-ng should start reading logs from the oldest available at first start (or if no bookmark can be found)
    - default value: yes
- fetch-delay
    - integer value, controls how much time syslog-ng should wait between reading/sending log messages, this is a fraction of a second, where wait_time = 1 second / n,  so, e.g. n=1 means that only about 1 log will be read and sent in each second, and n=1 000 000 means only 1 microsecond (the allowed minimum value now!) will be the delay between read/write attempts
    (Use with care, though lower delay time can increase log feed performance, at the same time could lead to a heavy system load!)
    - default value: 10 000
- fetch-retry-delay
    - integer value, controls how many seconds syslog-ng will wait before a repeated attempt to read/send once it's out of available logs
    - default value: 1
- log-fetch-limit
    - **Warning**: _This option is now disabled due to an OSLog API bug (https://openradar.appspot.com/radar?id=5597032077066240), once it's fixed it will be enabled again_
    - integer value, that limits the number of logs syslog-ng will send in one run
    - default value: 0, which means no limit

Please NOTE, the persistent OSLog store is not infinite, depending on your system setting usually, it keeps about 7 days of logs on disk, so it could happen that the above options cannot operate the way you expect, e.g. if syslog-ng was stopped for about more then a week it could happen that will not be able to restart from the last saved bookmark position (as that might not be presented in the persistent log already)

### darwin-oslog-stream

This is a wrapper around the OS command line "log stream" command that can provide a live log stream feed.
Unlike in the case of `darwin-oslog()` the live stream can contain non-persistent log events too, so take care, there might be a huge number of log events every second that could put an unusual load on the device running syslog-ng with this source.
Unfortunately, there's no public API to get the same programmatically, so this one is implemented using a program() source.

The following parameters can be used for customization:

- filter-predicate
    - defaults to an empty string, so all logs are fed by default, use carefully
    - see, `man log` for more details
- various command line options are available to filter/customize further the stream
    - please see, `log --help stream` for full reference
    - default value: `--type log --type trace --level info --level debug`
