manpages: Finally, we have added manpage generation to the CMake builds as well. The new single source of truth solution can either use the sometimes more up-to-date version from the [documentation](https://syslog-ng.github.io/admin-guide/190_The_syslog-ng_manual_pages/README), or, by default, the locally available ready-to-use instance (which is also synced from the online version, but may lag behind). This can be controlled via the `--with-mapages=local|remote`, or the `-DWITH_MANPAGES=LOCAL|REMOTE` configuration options.
