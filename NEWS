3.3.0beta2
	Fri, 12 Aug 2011 09:00:17 +0200

	Highlights
	==========

	This release has started using the officially assigned port numbers
	for RFC5424 based log transports. syslog-ng will properly use the
	old defaults if the configuration @version indicates an old config.

	This release contains all identified bug fixes published by the
	BalaBit syslog-ng team in their syslog-ng PE 4.1 release, additional
	features will be integrated into syslog-ng 3.4 as 3.3 is already
	feature-frozen.  See more deetails on the list of bugs fixed in the
	"bugfixes" section below.

	This release got a "beta" tag instead of a "release-candidate"
	because of the level of public testing it has received.  However all
	currently known bugs are believed to be fixed and this should be
	much better than beta1 was.

	Bugfixes:
	=========
	* Fixed a memory leak in macro based destination files.

	* Fixed the "dropped" and "stored" counters for the SQL destination,
	  which were swapped previously.

	* Fixed file sources to properly start the source file from the
	  beginning when restoring the persistent state failed.

	* Fixed BSD timestamp parsing, that caused an extra syslog header to
	  be added to messages which had a single digit day-of-the-month
	  (e.g. the first ten days for every month).

	* Fixed a possible crasher at exit, caused by the destinations being
	  flushed and the associated sources already cleaned up.

	* Fixed a destination specific memory leak, which caused some
	  hundred bytes to be leaked when the configuration was reloaded.

	* Set O_CLOEXEC for child program pipes, in order to avoid
	  inheriting those to other children.

	* Allow RFC5424 structured data blocks to have no parameters (e.g.
	  "[foo]", which only has an SDID and no SDPARAM).

	* Fixed the value of the $PRI macro which expanded to an empty
	  string if the priority was 0 (= kern.emerg)

	* Fixed a race conditions in template compilation and expansion,
	  that could cause segmentation faults and other nastiness.

	* Fixed a race condition in macro based file destinations, which
	  caused crashes when multiple sources wrote into the same file,
	  when the filename expanded to the same name from the multiple
	  connections.  (e.g.  using $PROGRAM in the filename and receiving
	  messages from different hosts running the same programs).

	* Fixed a possible segmentation fault in certificate validation,
	  when the peer certificate contains an X.509 certificate purpose
	  extension.

	* Try to load modules with the .a extension on AIX.

	* Fixed a possible crash in the socket source with optional(yes).

	* Made stats counters and their registration thread safe, which
	  either caused crashes if stats_level() > 1 or miscalculated values
	  due to parallel threads accessing the same counters.

	* Fixed a possible crash for unknown or mistyped source flags.

	* Fixed an fd and memory leak for opened destination connections.

	* Fixed possible crashes in SIGHUP handling in case syslog-ng is
	  busy processing messages.

	* Fixed a failed assertion in persistent-state handling, triggered
	  when multiple file sources are busy processing messages and
	  recording their current file position.

	* Fixed SCL block expansion, when passing the empty value for a
	  parameter.

	* The final flush that happens right before syslog-ng exits honoured
	  the throttle() value. Since this is an attempt to squeeze out
	  everything we have to the destination, it's best to ignore
	  throttle in this case.

	* Fixed a possible use-after-free and other crash causing problems
	  in file macro based destinations.

	* Fixed a massive memory leak of all processed messages, which were
	  triggered by a change past v3.3.0beta1, but was found in a git
	  snapshot.

	* Fixed keep-alive(yes) behaviour for destination drivers.

	* Messages generated by the db-parser() will be marked as local
	  messages.

	* Implemented locking callbacks for OpenSSL, without which enabling
	  SSL and threading mode almost guaranteed a crash in case multiple
	  connections were running SSL.

	* Fixed an issue with the SQL destination, which can cause stalls in
	  message processing.

	Build changes:
	==============

	* Added --with-module-path configure option that specifies the
	  default search path for modules. The help for the older
          --with-module-dir option was clarified, it indicates where
          syslog-ng Makefiles install modules.

	* The configure script automatically adds -pthread to the CC command
	  line. Hopefully this is indeed supported on all platforms (worked
	  on the ones I've tried), and avoids having to play dirty tricks
	  with macros like _REENTRANT and _THREAD_SAFE.

	* Link unit test programs against -livykis in case we're using a
	  system-installed ivykis, rather than our private copy.

	* Fixed compile issues on Solaris.

	* Updated to a newer libmongo-client (v0.1.3)

	* Updated to a newer ivykis version (v0.19 with syslog-ng specific
	  patches)

	Performance improvements:
	=========================

	* Use the GSlice allocator for objects allocated in the fast path.

	* Avoid another use of sprintf in the LogWriter fastpath.

	* Use per-thread caches for time related functions and the DNS cache.

	* Use the string representation of IP addresses in the DNS cache, as
	  inet_ntop() performs much worse than the cache.


	Other changes:
	==============

	* Functional tests: properly detect the presence of sqlite to do the
	  sql() testing.

	* The minimum permissible value for the log-iw-size was changed to
	  100 from 10, as the per-connection window calculation has changed. 
	  Earlier all connections shared the same window, starting with 3.3,
	  the window is distributed evenly to all connections, to avoid
	  starving (e.g. one connection starves the rest by using up the
	  window space) and to avoid thread synchronization in the message
	  processing fast path.

	* Ported per-facility, per-severity, per-program and per-host
	  counters from the PE version.

	* Other systemd unit files.

3.3.0beta1
	Fri, 13 May 2011 13:17:12 +0200

	Highlights:
	===========

	This release marks the feature freeze for the upcoming 3.3 version
	of syslog-ng, development continues on the newly opened 3.4 branch,
	while this one only receives bugfixes in the future.

	db-parser():
	============
	* db-parser() has a new option called inject-mode() that can be used
	  to specify where synthetic messages generated by syslog-ng itself
          should be injected. In 3.2 these appeared in the internal()
	  source, in 3.3 they'll be generated from within db-parser().

	* "pdbtool patternize": added --no-parse option

	sql():
	======
	* Make the number of retries runtime configurable in case an INSERT
	  is rejected by the database using the new retry-sql-inserts()
	  option.

	* Added support for using the "default" value for columns, by
	  specifying "default" as the column value. This can be used for
	  auto-incrementing fields.

	* Explicit commits were adapted to use the proper BEGIN TRANSACTION
	  command on MS SQL and Oracle.

	* Oracle doesn't like overly long index names, and since this limit
	  was easily reached by syslog-ng, use md5 to compress the index
	  name.

	* Removed the defaults for columns(), values() and indexes() as it's
	  almost impossible to come up with a set of defaults that works on
	  all databases.

	* DBI initialization errors are reported earlier, during startup, to
	  make their detection easier.

	file():
	=======
	* The owner(), group(), perm(), dir_owner(), dir_group() and
	  dir_perm() can be specified without an argument which tells
	  syslog-ng to avoid changing file permissions even if the globals
	  are set.

	mongodb():
	==========
	* The name of the collection was changed to be a simple string,
	  instead of a template, to make implementing bulk inserts much
	  easier.

        * Added support for the value-pairs() option, that makes it trivial
          to add fields to records dynamically.

	$(format-json):
	===============
	* A new module named tfjson was created which implements a
	  $(format-json) template function, capable of exporting the
	  syslog-ng message model as a properly marked up JSON object.

	* The plugin supports both json-c and json-glib as backend
	  implementations.

	Performance changes:
	====================
	* The LogQueue component was restructured for better scalability. 
	  This component is responsible to connect source and destination
	  drivers as they work in separate threads, and as such it plays an
	  important role in influencing the overall performance of syslog-ng.

	Loggen:
	=======
	* Added support for reading files in multi-threaded mode (each
	  thread sending a copy of that file, instead of mixing lines).

	* Added support for IPv6.

	Other changes:
	==============
	* The list of plugins loaded by default became build-time
	  configurable using the --default-modules configure switch. The
   	  same command line option can be used to override the same at
	  runtime.

	* --version now includes information on the list of available
	  modules, and --module-registry displays even more information on
	  every loadable module.

	* Introduced another plugin possibility, inner-source and inner-dest
	  plugin types allow the extension any kind of source or destination
	  driver.

	* Use the newly introduced "cap-syslog" capability with kernels
	  post-2.6.38.

	Build changes:
	==============
	* A new shared library was introduced named libsyslog-ng-crypto.so
	  that contains all crypto related code shared between plugins.

	* Added pkg-config files to be used in -dev packages in order to
	  make it possible to build external modules.

	* "make uninstall" now properly uninstalls config files and SCL.
	  Note that it removes everything without checking that they were
	  changed locally.

	Bugfixes:
	=========
	* The program destination caused a segmentation fault during
	  startup, this was fixed.

	* Fixed syslog() style framing over TLS or tcp, which caused the
	  syslog-ng server to shut connections down prematurely.

	* Fixed syslog() client code, which may cause invalid framing to be
	  emitted on contended network connections.

	* Fixed a possibly failed assert in the flow control code in
	  reaction to a broken source connection.

	* Fixed processing flush_timeout() for destinations, in earlier
	  alpha versions flush_timeout() never expired.

	* Some platforms return EINVAL for writev() calls with zero I/O
	  buffers, causing file output to fail. Make sure syslog-ng never
	  generates such calls.

	* Fixed read behaviour for special files (like /proc/kmsg on
	  Linux, /dev/klog for FreeBSD), as epoll/kqueue is unable to handle
	  these.

	* Fixed write behaviour for special files (like /dev/console) as
	  epoll/kqueue must be used even though syslog-ng doesn't use those
	  for regular files.

	* Fixed a premature connection closure when the destination is
	  unable to accept data (e.g. EAGAIN is returned from send()). This
	  was easily reproduced by enabling SSL, as SSL is reporting the
	  same condition when the negotiation is running and the client is
	  expecting the response from a server.

	* Fixed a 100% CPU usage case in the SSL server case.

	* Fixed a possible segmentation fault during runtime (use-after-free
	  problem which could cause segfaults).

	* Fixed a segmentation fault at exit when the tcp() destination
	  couldn't connect to the server.

	* Don't attempt to remember the file position for files that are
	  read using follow-freq(0), e.g. /dev/klog, /proc/kmsg and similar
	  files.

	* Fixed a db-parser() correllation bug, sometimes timers were not
	  expired as they should have. [3.2 port]

	* Accept three forms of the catch-all log statement flag: catch-all,
	  catchall and catch_all since the documentation was wrong and it
	  differed from the actual implementation for ages.

	* PCRE: fixed a potential resource hog triggered by PCRE 8.12 and
	  "global" replacements.

	* loggen: make sure loggen sends out all data by calling shutdown()
	  on the output socket.

	* loggen: handle SIGPIPE signals which caused loggen to exit
	  prematurely when connections broke.

	* loggen: fixed a potential division by zero when reporting the
	  message rate for unsuccessful connections.

	* Fixed a number of compilation warnings triggered by gcc 4.6

3.3.0alpha2
	Thu, 10 Mar 2011 12:51:36 +0100

	Features:
	========
	* Support for systemd activation added.

	* Add support for customizable token delimiters in "pdbtool
	  patternize", which makes the resulting patterns to have much
	  better quality.

	* Added support for a --no-parse command line option for "pdbtool
	  patternize" to avoid parsing the input as normal syslog messages.

	* Added a new flag 'ignore-errors' to LogWriter based destinations
	  (file, pipe, tcp, udp, syslog)

	* Added support for specifying the suppress() option globally.


	Bugfixes:
	=========
	* Fixed a tcp()/udp()/syslog() destination driver issue that caused
	  aborts during startup.

	* Handle non-epollable devices like /dev/null normally by failling
	  back to the regular file-like handling. Earlier these caused an
	  abort inside ivykis.

	* Makefile fixes to make it possible to compile syslog-ng from a
	  "make dist" tarball.

	* Added error messages about libdbi initialization failures, that
	  would prevent the SQL destination from working.

	* Make it possible to compile against PCRE not in a standard
	  location (caused compilation failures on FreeBSD).

	* Fixed several $(grep) related bugs:

	  - not to cause a segmentation faule when the filter expression
	    supplied contains syntax errors

	  - the template parsing code removed quotes required by filter
	    expressions, with the current change it is possible to use
	    quotes in the filter expressions directly:
               $(grep ('$username' == 'root') $MSG)

	  - fixed the handling of template function invocations within
	    correllation that had multiple messages in its context.

	* Fixed a segmentation fault in pdbtool match --debug-pattern in
	  case there was no matching rule.

	* Fixed "pdbtool test".

	* Added a new macro named $CONTEXT_ID that expands to the current
	  context-id in correllated rules.

	Other changes:
	==============
	* Changed the default syslog-ng.conf version number to 3.3 to match
	  the current version.

	* The pipe() destination used to override the default value of
	  flush_lines() by explicitly setting it to 0. This behaviour has
	  been removed, now the pipe() driver will properly use the default,
	  unless overridden explicitly.

	* Ported the 3.2 linking changes to 3.3, which means that:

	  - libsyslog-ng-patterndb.so is gone, both the command line pdbtool
	    command and the patterndb plugin (libpatterndb.so) links its
	    contents statically, to improve portability on Cygwin.

	  - unit tests & command line utilities link properly in
	    --enable-mixed-linking mode

	* Added debug messages in the correllation code to make it easier to
	  debug correllation rules.

	* Added debug/verbose options to pdbtool.

3.3.0alpha1
	Sun, 06 Feb 2011 17:30:51 +0100

	This is the first alpha release of the upcoming syslog-ng OSE 3.3,
	containing the following noteworthy changes over syslog-ng OSE 3.2.

	Features:
	=========
	* Added mongodb() destination driver to insert messages into
	  MongoDB, a NoSQL database.

	* Uses multiple threads for message reception and output for
	  scalability over multiple CPUs/cores.  To enable multiple threads
	  use threaded(yes) in the global options section of your
	  configuration file.

	* Uses epoll() instead of traditional poll() for increased
	  performance, using a thin abstraction layer implemented in the
	  ivykis library. A copy of ivykis is available in the source tree
	  of syslog-ng.

	* loggen was made multi-threaded and added the ability to open
	  several connections, instead of only one.

	* Other performance related tweaks.

	Important changes:
	==================
	* log_iw_size() is divided among all possible connections for a
	  connection oriented transport like unix-stream(), tcp() and
	  syslog(transport(tcp)). This is in contrast with earlier versions
	  which shared the same window for all connections. At the same time
	  the global log_iw_size()/log_fetch_limit() settings were removed.

	Bugfixes:
	=========
	* This release is synced with syslog-ng 3.2.2 bugfix-wise.
