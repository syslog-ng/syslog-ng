 * log_proto_get_char_size_for_fixed_encoding:
 *
 * This function returns the number of bytes of a single character in the
 * encoding specified by the @encoding parameter, provided it is listed in
 * the limited set hard-wired in the fixed_encodings array above.
 *
 * syslog-ng sometimes needs to calculate the size of the original, raw data
 * that relates to its already utf8 converted input buffer.  For that the
 * slow solution is to actually perform the utf8 -> raw conversion, however
 * since we don't really need the actual conversion, just the size of the
 * data in bytes we can be faster than that by multiplying the number of
 * input characters with the size of the character in the known
 * fixed-length-encodings in the list above.
 *
 * This function returns 0 if the encoding is not known, in which case the
 * slow path is to be executed.
