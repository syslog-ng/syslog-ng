 *
 * It is expected to be used at sites where the length is known and where
 * the input string is expected to be properly NUL terminated but not always.
 *
 * The macro checks if the string is indeed NUL terminated and if it is it
 * just assigns the original pointer to dest.  If it's not, it allocates a
 * new string via g_alloca() so it is automatically freed when the current
 * scope exits.
 *
 * This does not work as an inline function as we use g_alloca() and that
 * would be freed when the inline function exits (e.g.  when it is in fact
 * not inlined).

/* This version of strchr() is optimized for cases where the string we are

 * those cases we can avoid the strchr() call, which can make a tight loop
 * doing a lot of strchr() calls a lot faster, especially as this function
 * is inlined.
 *
 * Naming: I originally wanted to use the original function as a prefix
 * (strchr), however that would potentially pollute the namespace of the
 * library that we are optimizing.  So I've added an underscore prefix in
 * order not to clash, with that it is still obvious that it intends to
 * behave the same as strchr().
 *
 * NOTE: don't use this unless strchr() really shows up in your profile.
