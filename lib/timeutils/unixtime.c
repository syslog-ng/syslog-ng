   * This function fixes the timezone (e.g.  gmtoff) value of the incoming
   * timestamp in case it was incorrectly recognized at its previous
   * parsing and converts it to the correct timezone as specified by tzinfo.
   *
   * The complexity of this function is that daylight saving thresholds are
   * specified in local time (e.g.  whichever sunday in March/October) and
   * not as an UTC timestamp.  If the current UnixTime instance in @self was
   * incorrectly parsed, then its UTC timestamp will be off by a few hours.
   * (more specifically off by the number of hours between the two
   * timezones). We have to take this inaccuracy into account.
   *
   * The basic algorithm is as follows:
   *   1) first, we look up the gmtoff value of the target timezone based on
   *      the ut_sec value in the original timestamp.  This will only be
   *      correct if we don't cross a daylight saving transition hour (of
   *      the target timezone) in any direction.  We adjust the
   *      ut_sec/ut_gmtoff pair based on the result of this lookup, by:
   *
   *            ut_sec += target_gmtoff - source_gmtoff;
   *            ut_gmtoff = target_gmtoff;
   *
   *   2) It might happen that this changed ut_sec value (as pointed out
   *      above) either moves past the DST transition hour or moves
   *      right before it, changing the target gmtoff we've guessed at point
   *      #1 above.  We detect this by doing another lookup of the target
   *      timezone and then adjusting ut_sec/ut_gmtoff again.  This handles
   *      cases properly where we don't fall INTO the transition hour at
   *      this step.
   *
   *   3) If we are _within_ the transition hour, we need a final step, as
   *      in this case the transition between the two timezones is not
   *      linear we either need to lose or add an extra hour.  This one is
   *      detected using a 3rd lookup, as we if we are in the transition
   *      hour, the 2nd step will be incorrect and the final step would
   *      return the same gmtoff as the 1st. There are two cases here:
   *
   *
   *        a) 1st_gmtoff < 2nd_gmtoff: we were in DST but then the 2nd step
   *        moved us before, so let's add an hour to ut_sec so it's again
   *        _after_ the threshold.
   *
   *        b) 1st_gmtoff > 2nd_gmtoff: we were before DST and the 2nd step
   *        moved us into ut_sec wise, but our gmtoff does not reflect that.
   *        Add an hour to ut_gmtoff.
   *
   *      This will then nicely move any second between 02:00am and 03:00am
   *      to be between 03:00am and 04:00am, just as it happens when we
   *      convert these timestamps via mktime().
