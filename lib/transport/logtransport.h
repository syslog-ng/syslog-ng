/*
 * LogTransport:
 *
 * This is an interface that a LogProto implementation can use to do I/O.
 * There might be multiple LogTransport implementations alive for a specific
 * connection: for instance we might do both plain text and SSL encrypted
 * communication on the same socket, when the haproxy proxy protocol is in
 * use and SSL is enabled.  It might also make sense to instantiate a
 * transport doing gzip compression transparently.
 *
 * The combination of interoperating LogTransport instances is called the
 * LogTransportStack (see transport-stack.h)
 *
 * There's a circular, borrowed reference between the stack and the
 * constituent LogTransport instances.
